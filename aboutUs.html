			Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional
            recipes served with a modern twist.
            The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12-15 items that they
            rotate seasonally.
            The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal
            any time of the day.
    
            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
            shared dream of owning a restaurant.
            To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
            marketing for the restaurant and led
            the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean
            region.
